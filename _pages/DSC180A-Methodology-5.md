**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
I think LLM self reflection was the most interesting topic we covered in the research readings this quarter. There were so many papers we read that all centralized around this general notion of reflection whether though self-reflection or via a teacher model.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to explore these reasoning improvement implementations we do as applications to different domains like healthcare and medicine.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I would like to have 2 engineering teams in the Quarter 2 project instead of 1 working on different tasks and then meeting to see how we can collaborate off different ideas.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in utilizing RAG with a reasoning improved smaller model. Essentially combining reflection and RAG and then seeing its performance on domain specific reasoning tasks
