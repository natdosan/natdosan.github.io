## Hello!

I'm **Nate**, an undergraduate student studying Data Science with a concentration in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence at the [University of California, San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/). 

My research interests lie in the applications of machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence (ML / AI) in various domains such as <u>healthcare & neuroscience</u>, <u>computer vision</u>, <u>geospatial information systems (GIS)</u>, <u>sports analytics</u>, as well as any other applications of data science to various domains. As an aspiring data scientist and machine learning engineer, my strengths lie in bridging the harmonious intersection between ML / AI and these domains. Consequently, my goal is to gain experience in many different interdisciplinary uses of data science and machine learning. 

As of Spring 2024, I am on the market for Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 industry and research opportunities!

<!--- Currently, I am researching the fine-tuning LLMs for spatial information as well as investigating the causal relationships between different geospatial and socioeconomic factors, supervised by [Professor Ilya Zaslavsky](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilya-Zaslavsky). I am also fortunate enough to receive mentorship from Professor Julie Wartell on another ML/GIS application-based research project.--->

In the past year, I have been an <u>Undergraduate Student Instructor</u> for data science courses serving ~1200 students, led various machine learning projects for the [Data Science Society @ UCSD](https://www.ds3ucsd.com/), a <u>Machine Learning Intern</u> at [SDSC](https://www.sdsc.edu/), and a visiting student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/). 

Beyond work and academia, I enjoy art, music composition (huge Chopin, Debussy, Monet, Nara, and Murakami fan), cafe hopping & travelling (my extensive Google Maps lists available upon request :D), and language learning (ä¸­å›½,æ—¥æœ¬èªž, FranÃ§ais)
