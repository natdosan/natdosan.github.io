## Hello!

I am a fourth-year undergraduate completing a Bachelor's in Data Science with a concentration in ML/AI at the [University of California, San Diego](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/). I've previously spent wonderful summers interning at Bio-Rad (2024), San Diego Supercomputer Center (2023), Chan Zuckerberg Biohub (2022). I am also committed to ***democratizing data science education*** and have served as an Instructinal Assistant to over 1500 students at the Hacioglu Data Science Institute. After graduation I plan to pursue a Masters in Computer / Data Science. 

***[Resume / CV](assets/pdfs/CV.pdf)***

As an aspiring data scientist and machine learning engineer, my strengths lie in bridging the harmonious intersection between domains and machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML / AI). Consequently, my research interests primarily center around increasing robustness / decreasing Bias of ML methods and different interdisciplinary applications of data science and machine learning, which I have explored through projects in [computer vision](https://natdosan.github.io/exploringcnn.pdf), [LLM's](/assets/pdfs/CSE_151B___PA5___Report.pdf), [geospatial information systems (GIS)](https://natdosan.github.io/A_Causal_Analysis_on_Public_Transportation_in_NYC.pdf), and industry experience in applications for <u>bioinformatics, biotech, and healthcare</u>. 

Outside of academia, I enjoy olympic weightlifting, art, music composition (Chopin, Debussy, Monet, Nara, and Murakami fan), coffee, interior design, and travelling (my extensive Google Maps lists available upon request ðŸ™‚), and language learning (ä¸­å›½, æ—¥æœ¬èªž, FranÃ§ais).
<!--
Currently, I am researching the usage of Retrieval-Augmented Generation for making LLM's more robust to geospatial information, advised by Professor [Ilya Zaslavsky](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilya-Zaslavsky). I am also fortunate enough to receive mentorship from Professor [Julie Wartell](https://jwartell.ucsd.edu/) on another ML/GIS application-based research project.
