## Hello!

My name is **Nate**. I am an undergraduate student studying Data Science with a concentration in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence at the <u>University of California, San Diego</u>. In the past year, I have been an <u>Undergraduate Student Instructor</u> for data science courses, a <u>Machine Learning Intern at SDSC</u>, and a visiting student at the <u>University of California, Berkeley</u>. 

My research interests lie in the applications of machine/deep learning and artificial intelligence (ML / AI) in various domains such as <u>healthcare</u>, <u>neuroscience</u>, <u>computer vision</u>, <u>geospatial information systems (GIS)</u>, <u>sports analytics</u>, as well as any other applications of data science to various domains. As an aspiring data scientist and machine learning engineer, my goal is to gain experience in many different interdisciplinary uses of data science and machine learning. As a result, I have tailored my projects to explore many different domains, and my strengths lie in bridging the interdisciplinary intersection between ML / AI and these domains.

As of Spring 2024, I am on the market for Summer 2024 and Fall 2024 industry and research opportunities!

<!--- I am currently researching the fine-tuning LLMs for spatial information as well as investigating the causal relationships between different geospatial and socioeconomic factors, supervised by [Professor Ilya Zaslavsky](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ilya-Zaslavsky)--->

Beyond work and academia, I enjoy art, music composition (huge Chopin, Debussy, Monet, Nara, and Murakami fan), cafe hopping & travelling (my extensive Google Maps lists available upon request :D), and language learning (ä¸­å›½,æ—¥æœ¬èªž, FranÃ§ais)
